# Physcio Ease Web Application

## Problem Statement
Access to quality physiotherapy care is a significant challenge, particularly for individuals in rural or underserved areas and those with demanding schedules.

Traditional in-person physiotherapy services lack the flexibility and technological integration needed for modern healthcare. Patients face difficulties in finding specialists, scheduling appointments, and maintaining consistent recovery routines. 
Meanwhile, physiotherapists struggle with practice management, remote patient tracking, and expanding their reach

Our web application aims to bridge these gaps by providing a platform for remote consultations and continuous care,enhancing accessibility and efficiency. This project aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by improving healthcare access and quality, and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) by breaking down geographic barriers and offering equal treatment opportunities.
